# PHP Combined Logbooks Version 2.0

## Overview

This repository contains my coursework for CO551 Open-Source Systems, under the guidance of Lecturer Jon Jackson. The project is a compilation of logbooks detailing my journey through PHP development. Each logbook is structured to enhance understanding and skills progressively, covering a wide range of topics from basic PHP syntax to complex interactions with databases and handling multimedia.

## Contents

- **Logbook 1**: Introduction to PHP, focusing on creating and running basic PHP scripts, exploring PHP variables, arrays, and basic data manipulation.
- **Logbook 2**: Advanced PHP features including iteration, control structures, and an introduction to functions.
- **Logbook 3-4**: HTML form handling with PHP, processing user input, and introducing server-side storage and retrieval.
- **Logbook 5-6**: Database interactions with PHP, focusing on MySQL connectivity, creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (CRUD operations).
- **Logbook 7**: Handling multimedia in PHP, storing and retrieving images and audio from a database, and displaying them in a web page.
